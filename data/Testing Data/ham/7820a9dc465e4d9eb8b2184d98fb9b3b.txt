Actually, this issue used to escalate into a religious war. The "From " 
envelope is an artifact of the mbox mailbox format, and from that 
perspective it should be the mail server that stores its mailboxes in
mbox format that should be responsible for escaping lines beginning with 
"From ". On the other hand, this breaks the assumption that the mail 
transport only touches the message headers and leaves the message body 
alone.
Things like pgp signatures break when the mail server changes the message 
body.
Also, strictly speaking, the mbox format envelope (or for us old-timers, 
the UUCP envelope) isn't just any line beginning with "From ". It's really 
"From", a single space, a valid email address, two spaces, and a valid 
date.
For example:
    From ptardif@nbnet.nb.ca  Sun Jul 14 08:53:57 2002
