Halloechen!
If I create an RPM according to one of the how-to's with having
Red Hat in mind, how big are my chances that it will also work
for the SuSE distribution, or others?  (I don't know how many
base on the RPM system.)
Or what must I pay attention to when creating an RPM that should
work with the big distributions?
Tschoe,
Torsten.
