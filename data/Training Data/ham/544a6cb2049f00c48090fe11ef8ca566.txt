I paid for CuteFTP on my Windows box.  Well worth the money despite there 
being free alternatives, no regrets whatsoever.
Now that Mozilla isn't taking X down twice a day I'm unlikely to pay for 
Opera, but if that hadn't happened around the same time I made the switch 
to 100% unix I would have been happy to.
