  The way Razor breaks down mail is simple.  If a mail contains MIME
  boundaries it is split on those boundaries, each MIME part is considered 
  when marking the mail as spam.
  
  In 2.14, there are different 'logic methods' for detecting spam.
  The default method 5 requires all non-contention parts to be spam for
  the mail to be marked as spam.  A part is considered under
  contention if its not clear if its spam are not, and is relatively
  rare.
  Sounds like you are not using 2.14, or maybe you're misinterpreting
  the log files.  Feel free to send me the log files if you think 
  there is a bug.
  Also, as jordan says, if you get a legit mail marked as spam (based
  on whatever MIME stuff is going on), you should revoke it (which sends
  all parts in) so TeS can take care of business.  
  cheers,
