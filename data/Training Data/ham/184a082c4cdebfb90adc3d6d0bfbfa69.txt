The history of crime and punishment illustrates the need for /both/,
and while there are slaughter-maxima people living in Queens (or
Montreal or Milan or ...), I would not condone blanket justifications
to "cure" everyone who looks like them with suspended rights and
violence.  Do we suspect every tall black man because of OJ Simpson?
By the logic of that article, which is apparently endorsed by at least
a few FoRKers, should I keep all Americans at an arms distance for
fear I'll be infected with the same paranoiac blood-lust meme-virus?
After-all, it's a disease, just like a plague, right?  
Ok, ok, so maybe I /do/ keep a few Yanks in quarantine, fenced off
with chickenwire out in the back 40, but that's besides the point. At
least I feed them.
Wait, wait ... enough tit-for-tat, how about a technical question: How
would _you_ /know/ if you _were_ infected?  Wouldn't the schizophrenia
of the diseased meme be transparent to you, perfectly bonded into your
reality?
    N> People require a touch more effort.
Spoken exactly like those people I do not understand, because the
specist statement is patently false by /all/ measures known to
science, yet they so adamantly believe the farce is truth.  Would you
also believe the Earth is at the center of the Universe, put here for
our exclusive enjoyment because God loves us best?
"To the enlightened mind, there is no difference between a Brahmin
and a dog" --- guess which moral relativist said it and where.
