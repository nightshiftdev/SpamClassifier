I'm configuring this at the moment. -> Still ;--)
I found out that my firewall box has a dodgy USB and so I'm awaiting a
PCI-USB controller to finish the configuration. I meant to buy one yesterday
and forgot. I've bought Smoothwall Corporate edition as its the best
firewall/routing solution around or so I've been led to believe. 
Will be doing NAT/Proxy/firewall, maybe VPN too but we shall see.

Hi all,
	I am seriously thinking of getting the ADSL "solo" connection
from Eircom. I also have more than one computer therefore I need a router
so that I can connect them together.
The 2 options I am looking at are : 
  the ADSL usb modem connected to my linux machine, with the linux
	machine acting as firewall; and
  a combined router / firewall box which would be connected directly
	to the ADSL modem.
So my questions are : 
	what recommendations would any of you have about the above ?
	do I need to have NAT (I have only a vague idea of what this does )?
	what other options should I be looking at ?
Thanks
Con
