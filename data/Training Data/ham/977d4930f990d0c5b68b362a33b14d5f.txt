This is the problem, it's not the people who buy the machine that
end up installing on it.
We're actually investigating switching from Sparc/Solaris to 
Intel/Linux. I would much prefer to be using Linux at work
so I'm pushing for this. It definately doesn't help when 
you're given a bog standard Dell box and linux won't work
with the graphics card on it.
At the moment at work, if we want a new workstation, we just
buy whatever Sun's latest system is, we jumpstart it, and 
that's it, it's up and running.
Basically the whole installation procedure is
"boot net - install"
This is exactly what you need when you are administering a large
group of workstations. You don't have the time to check dells
website every time you want to buy a machine, you'd spend
your life on Dells website and messing around with drivers
and compiling new versions of X. That's fine if you've got
one machine at home, hey, I've done it myself, but
when working with a large bunch of systems, it's impossible.
