howdy all,
I have in my possession the following:
2/3     Apple toner cartridges    M20 45G/A for laser writer 300 / 320 /
and 4/600 PS
1     Apple toner cartridge     M2473G/A  for laser writer 16/600PS /
pro 630 / pro 600
1     Cannon EP-A cartridge
1     Cannon EP-E cartridge
(the numbers might be a little less)
Does anyone have one of these printers? Does anyone want to give me the 
change in their pockets, or the price of a pint for them?
They would make a great Christmas present!
If so you can call the printer cartridge hotline on the number below.
If lines are busy call later. But do call NOW!
