Actually it is (sort of).
To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once
the %files error was corrected :
rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit <specfile>
This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course,
you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_
produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able
to finish successfully.
Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because
entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really
installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're
writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-)
It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables
during install, when the simple cases like "%makeinstall" or "make install
DESTDIR=%{buildroot}" don't work. It keeps you from redoing all the
unpacking and building processes.
