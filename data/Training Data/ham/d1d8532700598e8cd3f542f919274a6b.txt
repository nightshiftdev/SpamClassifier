) 
) 1) What *exactly* does "Unable to connect to honor.cloudmark.com:2703; Reason: Operation now in progress." mean ??? I have seen this error message some 1700 times today (between 2 clustered servers) representing a little over 1% failure rate. In an enterprise level I was hoping for more along the lines of maybe one-tenth that .....
  It's a network error - That string is not created by 
  Razor Agents.  Its trying to connect and having trouble.  
  1700 times seems abnormally high.  How many successful
  connections were there in the same timespan?
) 2) Related somewhat to question 1: is there (or will there be if currently not) a way of adjusting the timeout the setting for the razor-check to await a response from the server it queries? I am running this as a sendmail milter and adjusting the milter timeouts won't help if the razor-check script times out first anyway ....
  The timeout is hardcoded to 15 secs.  
  No plans right now to make that an option.
  You can always edit the source - Core.pm.  :)
) 3) What are the plans for fire.cloudmark, apt.cloudmark, ubik.cloudmark?  It seems that we have all these catalogue servers yet a good portion of the time, only one is available or the last discovery ends up only listing one (currently honor.cloudmark) in the cataloge.lst file.
  The system is designed so servers can be added and 
  subtracted without the clients caring - if the razor
  client can't connect to a server, it re-discovers, getting
  all currently available servers and stores results locally.
) 4) What would be the implications/requirements/caveats of hosting a catalogue server or, at the minimum, a caching server (similar to the way mail-abuse.org, for example, does dns zone transfers of its rbl list -- I realize that this is a completely different mechanism, but you get the point I am driving at here). I realize that there is an issue of polluting the catalogue but perhpas there could be some way of certifying a catalogue server? What type of bandwidth considerations are we looking at here? (It is just the signatures that are actually transferred across the pipes, is it not?)
  We are looking into releasing caching catalogue servers 
  for those besides us to use.
) It really looks like there is a great potential here for a very workable tool and if I can get some of these issues addressed or can even be of some assistance, all the better .....
