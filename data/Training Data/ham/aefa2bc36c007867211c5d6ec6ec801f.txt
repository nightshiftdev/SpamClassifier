Limbo beta2 ? I'm running Limbo 7.3.92 with kernel 4.2.18-5.58, is what I am running
an "older" version of the Limbo beta, it is it "the" limbo beta?
btw, it does have that gconf editor included.
I dumped the RPMS from the Limbo cd's 1 to 3 onto a drive, ran a few scripts, edited
sources.list (rpm file:///path-to-files/RPMS.os os [I think]) and used "apt-get
dist-upgrade", worked like a charm. The real RH installer couldnot handle an upgrade
for me, it froze "searching for packages".
