Since perl itself is a scripting language, and allows code to be eval'ed,
I can't see why we need to go the whole hog and implement another
turing-complete scripting language in perl.
Let's go back to *why* this would be useful.  As far as I can see, you're
proposing this to deal with multi-match rules.  There's already a tracker
in the bug DB for these, with a proposed implementation.
  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47
I think this might have stalled due to shortcomings in the existnig
proposal, so I've just added my own thoughts on how to implement them. ;)
Comments on the proposed system would be welcome folks.... reply to the
bug db.
