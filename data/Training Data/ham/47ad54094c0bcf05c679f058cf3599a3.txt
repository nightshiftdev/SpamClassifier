That won't work like you want.  You'll end up with a boot loader
on the backup disk that contains the 'physical' location of
the /boot/map file on the main disk.  That won't necessarily
be the same as the backup disk.
I can't think of a right way to do his with LILO.  I've got
a similar seup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk
every night), but I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to
get LILO sorted if I have to do a disk swap.
GRUB should be able to handle this no problem, since it
doesn't record sector numbers like LILO does.  Not much help
for you though...
Later,
