Hi,
I've installed Quake 3 onto my computer and it starts to run up ok but as
soon as the graphics start it bails out.  It complains that there is an
error in sis_drv.o,  the line before this says that it is starting Quake in
24 bit depth, now from http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsis630.shtml I
understand that the sis630 won't do 24 bit depth.  So is there a way to make
Quake start up in 16 bit depth?  I've done some "google"ing but drawn a
blank.....
Thanks
Greg
