Ah the great spam debate wages on ...
So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-)
Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is
that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school
accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of
mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go
through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends
that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into
the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )  
Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I
haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my
carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets
considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down.
When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or
whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even
_better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change
my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I
can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to
my @hotmail account.
I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only
fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting
to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be
willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist
provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was
referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us
tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the
whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more
knowledgable.
My half a cent here...
<sidenote>: I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving
thing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :)
Woo hoo!   Law school!)   </sidenote>
