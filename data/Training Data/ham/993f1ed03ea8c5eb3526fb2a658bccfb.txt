Actually you would be inaccurate in your action in a way. The correct 
behavior would be to unsubscribe razor-users@fsckit.net from the mailing 
list.
But in any case, you have to understand that you and him would not be 
the only one involved. As I said in a another thread, you probably get 
hurt only if you are against the majority of people (which makes sense). 
If you are with the majority, you get a bonus (which also makes sense). 
If there is no majority, nobody wins or lose.
Razor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority, 
not for the individual. If one doesn't agree with the majority, he 
should use the razor-whitelist or create a blacklist (BTW, why doesn't 
razor provide a razor-blacklist too?)
