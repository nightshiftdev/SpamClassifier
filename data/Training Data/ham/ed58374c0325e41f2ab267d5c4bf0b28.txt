While wandering through Uppsala, Sweden last week, I ran across the
"Keramik" studio of Paula von Freymann. Her pottery work has the theme of
"fossils for the future", and she has two main lines of this work. One is
more conventional, taking leaves from plants at the nearby Linneas Gardens
and impressing them into the clay before firing, leaving a "fossil" of the
plant.
The other is more unique, taking imprints of circuit boards, cellular
telephones, punched cards, etc. and then firing the result to make "IT
fossils." Given how quickly most of our work becomes obsolete, I found the
offbeat notion of IT fossilization an oddly fitting way of archiving the
physical detritus of the digital age.

My guess is she'd gladly make fossils of any object you wanted, for a price.
Could be an interesting memorial of your next product launch!
