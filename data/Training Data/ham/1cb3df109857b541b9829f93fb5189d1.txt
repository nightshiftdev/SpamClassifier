I just wanted to second what Stephen says, from an independent
perspective:  The few times I've encountered an obstacle installing
current Linux distributions on Dell boxes, it's been because Dell were
an early adopter of (e.g.) a new Adaptec SCSI chipset, which hadn't 
been included in all installation kernels.  And that is the risk you
_always_ take when you blindly buy hardware systems for Linux without
verifying chipset support, first.  If anything, Dell have over the years
occasioned less such trouble than have many competitors, in this area.
