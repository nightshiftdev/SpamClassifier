Hiya folks,
I'm currently running RawHide, since I had the brilliant idea that, by
using APT, it might actually be practical to keep up with the
developments.
However, APT seems to want a recompile - its sometimes leaving the RPM
database in need of a db_recover - and gcc 3.2 seems to require a closer
adherence to the standard than the C++ in APT was written for.
This is a bit of a bummer.
Does anyone know if there's a latest version I could try which might
work, or whether I should simply do the porting myself? (I've made a
start, but there's a fair amount of work to do.)
If this works out, I might start a repository for the freshrpms compiled
on vLatest RawHide, for my own purposes and anyone else who's
interested.
Dave.
