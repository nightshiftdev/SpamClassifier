I send mail detected by Razor as spam to the spamtrap, which again reports it 
as spam. Before I added the procmail rule to revoke (as my real life account) 
Bugtraq messages that were flagged as spam, I manually revoked them as the 
spamtrap (which keeps the last 32 messages sent to it). Thus the spamtrap 
both reported as spam and revoked the same message. What happens to its trust 
rating?
Btw, what does "TeS" stand for?
