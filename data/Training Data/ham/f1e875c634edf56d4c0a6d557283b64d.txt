Any sage advice on the most painless way to upgrade from old limbo (.92) to new
limbo (.93)?
Apt for rpm from the 7.3 days barely works on Limbo1, and the package:
apt-0.5.4cnc6-dwd2.src.rpm will not compile on the Libbo1 box (I was going to use
that to dist-upgrade to Limbo2).
Compile gave error on file "genpkglist.cc". First, it included "rpm/header.h" ok,
but 2 other includes from that file (rpmio.h, hdrinline.h) could not be found. So I
further patched the enviorment file to have "-I/usr/include/rpm".
I guess that worked, but then I get this error (see below).
Ohh... the pain. Any advice?

That's "angle" as in geometry.
