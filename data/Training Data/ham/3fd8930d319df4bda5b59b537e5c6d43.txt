I call it spam if I ask to be removed from the spamming list though. 
I occasionally buy X-10 stuff.  I've learned from past experiences to 
create a quick mail alias to get order confs and what not.  Then can 
it once the order is complete because those spamming SOBs will not 
stop filling my inbox with 3-6 ads per day.  I've LARTed them and 
their upstream numerous times asking to be list washed.  I don't even 
get an auto-ack.  I started a procmail recipe to reject mail to them 
and include a form letter (I was planning on later appending every 
piece of x-10 spam I've archived to the form letter for their reading 
pleasure...) but I haven't gotten it to work.  Bottom line, if I gave 
them permission to mail me (explicitly or via privacy policy), it's 
not spam but once I told them to stop mailing me then it's spam.
