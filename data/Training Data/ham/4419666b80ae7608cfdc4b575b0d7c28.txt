Hi all...
I'm new to SpamAssasin so I appologies if the question has been asked
before.
I'm thinking of setting up SA with my Qmail(Maildir) server acting as our
gateway.
It currently provides inline virus scanning and ORDB open relay filtering.
Is it possible to setup SA to act as a sitewide Spam filter ?
Is there any documentation on setting this up ?
The Qmail server does not house any local mail accounts, it acts as a pure
relay for our internal mail server, I am currently relaing mail for 8
internal domains...
Suggestions would be appreciated.
Regards
Zenn
