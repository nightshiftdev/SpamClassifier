Kate asked about this several months ago, and I posted some code and hints on 
how to work around this problem. AFAIR, you simply refer to the form elements 
by their names, including brackets, but put " or ' around them, ie:
val = "document.form.city[1]";
I think that works, there's an answer to this question on http://faqts.com/ 
where I got the original answer.
Donncha.
