Well, the 7.3 binary should work as long as you install the "rpm404" (IIRC)
compatibility library. The only problem I have with some rpm 4.1 versions
is that it sometimes hangs at the and of operations (-e, -i, -F or -U) and
the only workaround is to kill it, "rm -f /var/lib/rpm/__*" and try again.
