Marc,
The likelyhood of EFF or other mailing lists getting filtered will
decrease over time as these mails are revoked whenever they get filtered
out. Revocations help the system to punish reporters who report legit bulk
mail such that their future reports are automatically considered suspect.
As such, with all the new changes to TeS, the likelyhood of filtering
mailing list posts has decreased dramatically. Please keep me posted if
you see false positives on the EFF newsletter again.
cheers,
vipul.
