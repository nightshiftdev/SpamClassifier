You could also change your e-mail to a more responsible provider. If Eircom
are not up to scratch, then use somebody else and make sure you let Eircom
know why you think they are so useless. You can still keep your old e-mail
address if you have to.
To suggest that ISP's should not protect themselves against incompotent
configurations would effectively be a vote in support of SPAM.
