IIRC, if the query string contains
varname=FIRST&varname=SECOND
then PHP will create a variable called "varname" with result SECOND. 
However, if the query string contains
varname[]=FIRST&varname[]=SECOND
then PHP will create an array with varname[1]==FIRST and varname[2]==SECOND
There are other ways to get the data from the HTTP request, and I guess 
I'll do that if it turns out to simplify the script that creates the 
form; but as i understand it that's the "official" way to get data from 
a SELECT MULTIPLE using PHP.
