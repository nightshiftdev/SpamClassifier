Frequency of messages does _not_ let you draw valid conclusions about the
understanding of the issues at hand of the sender.
IMHO it's sometimes even inversely proportional.

This should not impress you so much. At one time I even detected my name
on that page and I contributed less than a handful of rather simple rules.
That's not to say I don't appreciate Marc's contributions to the effort.
But in his place I would have (hopefully :) reevaluated my arguments in the
face of, as I saw it, massive rejection of his idea what constitutes spam.
Maybe this list can return to discussing technical topics. Politics should
go to spamassassin-talk.
