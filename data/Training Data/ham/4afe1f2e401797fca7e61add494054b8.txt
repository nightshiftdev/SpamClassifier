That *.ss file is really a tar file, I had to use the linCVS pre-compiled binary
from their ESP install thingie because the one I compiled on my RH box would not run
on as many systems. The guy said something like this: "it's an evil binary that only
runs on one system", so I took the hint :)
NOTE: I think I understand why RPM makes you go thru the whole build process: prep,
patch, build, install, package ... there are ways to get around this, but the
package would not be "from pristine sources" so to speak. I read that the 1st big
change they made to RPM was to always use "pristine" sources, then have prep apply
the packager's patches; whereas the early RPMS were already RH patched, apparently,
not having the "pristine" sources as the author had released them.
Just a guess ... ???

That's "angle" as in geometry.
