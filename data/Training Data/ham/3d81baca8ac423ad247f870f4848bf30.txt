Sorry, gang, but I've flipped the switch. If your posting address 
doesn't match your subscription address, or if you've instructed a robot 
to forkpost on your behalf, it'll get held, silently, for me or Kragen 
to review. Which will be rarely, so be warned.
Let's see how this works out for a week or so...
