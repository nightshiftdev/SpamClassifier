I just use Mozilla, and don't have to think about ignoring toolbar ads
altogether. I can tell Mozilla to ignore particularly obnoxious ads, and 
businesses who're particularly "clever" about making me see them obviously 
don't want me to see them after all (since I leave, and never come back).

I notice Opera tends to ignore my advertisement preferences, so this is 
the core reason why I don't use it. Mozilla does almost everything Opera 
does, minus the obnoxious ad slime, so why use use Opera then?
