Another theory is that Europe was a rural backyard until the Renaissance,
certainly when compared to big urban centres like Constantinople and Baghdad.
I don't know the genetic studies of which you speak, but I know of one that
is sort-of relevant: apparently men of Ashkenazi descent are susceptible
to sickle-cell anemia and the probable reason is that the same genetic
factor that causes that also protects women from tuberculosis (IIRC), which
would have come in handy in central European towns at a time when the Jewish
population was a lot more urbanised than average Joes.
