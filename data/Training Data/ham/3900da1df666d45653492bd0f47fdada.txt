I was thinking you could easily create a spamtrap which you 
subscribe to lots of legitimate nonspam mailing lists, plus you 
also spread the email address around and get it in the hands of 
lots of spammers so it ends up receiving large quantities of 
both spam and nonspam, then you have it apply the algorithm 
above to the incoming mail stream.  So it could be thousands of 
actual real, different, emails per day.  The "very high rate 
triggers alarms" thing is certainly something which would be 
possible to check for, but there may be legitimate ways to 
exhibit this behavior -- can't think of one right now but "AOL 
proxy server" springs to mind as an example from another domain.
