suggestion...
as I see it, there is a valid need for a "razor-cache" server that is
available to the local smtp host...
recursiveness would also be a nice feature, giving us the option to link
caches to offload the burden on the razor servers...
it could also allow us to setup local razor caches for private networks that
can bypass the razor servers all together...
any commensts ?
