I do not have the time to follow the compiler "wars", but I notice that I
must use egcs to build 64 bit SPARC code.
GCC 3 should do it, but because it is so "buggy"[1] it is not worth trying
to use unless you really want to track down those compiler errors... :(

[1] "buggy" in the sense that its a feature. Many of the problems with GCC 3
seem to be related to stricter syntax checking. More accurate information
will be appreciated.
