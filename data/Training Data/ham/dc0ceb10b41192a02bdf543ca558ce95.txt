I rigged this up for testing before I commit to a sitewide rollout of
Spamassassin as an SMTP relay.
It is more work, but it avoids sitewide changes in mail delivery during the
early stages of testing.
On the Exchange server... (mail.yourdomain.com)
Create a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the
mailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address.
Create a "custom recipient" with the old SMTP address
(spammedalot@yourdomain.com). Create another custom recipient pointing at a
local user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com).
Set the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom
recipient. (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory)
On the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com)
Set up a dummy user, in this case "killspam"
Give killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private
smtp address back on the Exchange server.
So the message flow is like this:
Mail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for
spammedalot@yourdomain.com
spammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to
killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com
Following the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to
nomorespam@yourdomain.com
Wowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second
one I protected was postmaster.
As you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one
dummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address
you want to protect. Like I said, it is more work, but until I am done
load-testing, this is the way it will stay.
