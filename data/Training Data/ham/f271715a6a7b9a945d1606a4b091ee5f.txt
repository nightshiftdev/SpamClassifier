The impression I get from reading lkml the odd time is
that IDE has gone downhill since Andre Hedrick was 
effectively removed as maintainer. Martin Dalecki seems
to have been unable to further development without 
much breakage. However, this is part of the fun of
the development kernel. Alan and others are annoyed
because they can't do any development themselves while
IDE is broken. Hopefully the 2.4 IDE port should help.
