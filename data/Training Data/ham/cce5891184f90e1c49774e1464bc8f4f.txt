I don't know what role ns0 plays in relation to the IE zone. It's
certainly not involved in the regular resolution process. It may
be involved in zone distribution as you suggest. IIRC (and I often
don't) on Friday ns0 had a serial that none of the IE nameservers 
shared. Unfortunately I don't have a record of that.

As an aside, shortly after my note on Friday uucp-gw-1.pa.dec.com and
uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com stopped responding to DNS requests. So IE had
two dead nameservers, four stuck a week in the past and three
working correctly. Marvellous.
