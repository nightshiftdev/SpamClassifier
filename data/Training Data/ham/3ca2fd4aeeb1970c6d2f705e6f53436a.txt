 Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs 
version of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a 
few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the 
kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 
(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due 
to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended 
compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs 
start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some 
of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about 
(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, 
it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined 
but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare 
for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup 
particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large 
parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance 
made large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.
that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the
kernel :(
(Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think
they eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...
