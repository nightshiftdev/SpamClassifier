Just a note to say that the Basque government has payed for having
Mandrake translated to Basque (and release all the changes), so that you
can just install it and the desktop and apps can be in your language. I
think that whichever organization (Irish government I suppose) is in
charge of promoting Irish here could learn a lot from them. 
The Basque government used to pay MS for translating Windows, but they
got pissed off because it was extremely expensive and the translations
would come out when the software was already obsolete. Now they promote
Free Software while helping the language at the same time, I think it's
a win-win situation ;).
cheers,
