Well, why not try Linux on Sparc. It works pretty well and I have not had
major issues with it. There are minor problems: like the serial console
drivers, but for workstation installs I suspect it will work fine.
And you get a working version of your favourite KDE/Gnome desktop instead of
DTE, uhm, I mean CDE.

Well, you have to add the workstation to the install server first.
Talking of which, you can install Sparc Linux using this technique as well.
The image takes a while to load, but once this is done you can install in
the normal fashion.
SuSe for Sparc works fine. I am using Debian because the Sun boxen I have
subverted do not have graphics consoles. It also just works.
If you have a spare workstation, I am sure I could burn a couple of CD's for
you. (If I can find them.)
