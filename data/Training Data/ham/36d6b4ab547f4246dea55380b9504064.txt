Well, I stand corrected :-)
The thing is, I hadn't used gconf-editor yet... and it's exactly what I
feared, old "not so good" memories are coming back : It looks exactly like
a GNOME RegEdit :-/ Oh well.
I still hope that the few missing features I'm still looking for will be
added in the next 2.0.x releases, like for example being able to have the
panel always under *all* other windows (if you know how to do that, I'm
really interested! ;-)).
Cheers,
Matthias
