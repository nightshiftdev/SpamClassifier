I've been using the gstreamer repository with Rawhide Gnome 2 for the
last month or so with no problems. Even the new rhythmbox works (if
you can call taking 5 minutes to load my mp3 directory "working").
It might be something with Ximian's Gnome 2 snaps. AFAIK, they're 
pretty much straight out of CVS and hence a lot more experimental than 
some of the other Gnome 2 packages out there.
