As yet another wave of people I know seem to have lost their jobs last week,
here is the latest in what I'm seeing...
* Even knowing a CTO/CEO/CFO may not even get your resume looked at, the
feedback I'm getting is that hiring managers are only considering family
and extended family for jobs - everyone has plenty of unemployed relatives.
* Most job sites are now almost empty - so the practice of posting "resume
bait" jobs is coming to an end. The postings they do have are months old
bait. This is now a completely pointless way to look for a job.
* We're almost flatlne in jobs created for several months, where population
growth needs about 120k jobs a month to keep things steady.
* Unemployment rates are only staying steady becasue people drop out of the
workforce number after they cant find a job for a long time. The "not in
labor force" is rising 400k a month. International numbers are no better -
technology is replacing people, especially the people tha tmake the
technoogy.
* Grad school programs are stuffed full of people for every non-tech major.
Colleges are having big headaches dealing with all the day-job refugees.
* Spam for porn, ink, and stocks has dropped off, spam (the english ones I
see subject lines for) now seems to be dominated by work-at-home scams and
resume services. That's got to be a BAD sign.
* FoRK is now almost all spam, somebody fix the damn subscriber-only-posting
setting already, dont make me show up at your house Rohit ;)
