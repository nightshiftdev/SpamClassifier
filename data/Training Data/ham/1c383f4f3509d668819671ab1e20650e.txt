Of course was genetic engineering. It used the fundamental mechanism of 
genetics (inheritance of traits), and not randomly, but 
intentionally--breeding for long fur, fat hams, whatever. The degree to which 
the engineers--farmers, breeders--understood exactly how the mehcanism works 
is only marginally relevant to the question of whether it was engineering. 
Science progresses. Over the years, centuries, their, our, knowledge 
increased, and domestication became more effective. Bit by bit the mechanisms 
became known--Mendel making a major breakthrough. The first hybrid grains 
(which date from the 1920s) represent another step. Watson and Crick another, 
etc. But it's engineering--just as Roman architecture was civil engineering, 
even if they knew less about the mathematics behind it than we do today, just 
as Galen was a physician, though laughably ignorant by our standards.
