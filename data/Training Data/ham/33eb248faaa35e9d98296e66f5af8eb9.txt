Yes, I know, dreadful subject. However, because of customer inistence we
must deploy one project on W2K. This will thus be a WAMP project rather than
a LAMP project. Of course as a highly skilled *ix person I can handle these
Windows toys :-) but can anyone suggest any good educational resources for
using Apache, PHP, Perl and MySQL together on W2K. Anyone had to do the same
and found any particular nasty gotchas (yes, I know about the running
Microsoft software one).
