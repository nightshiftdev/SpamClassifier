Hi,
Four of the IE nameservers are publishing out of date DNS information.
The four listed below are publishing the IE zone from last Friday.
They are six days behind reality.
 192.16.202.11    NS.EU.NET.
 192.93.0.4       NS2.NIC.FR.
 198.133.199.102  GNS1.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.
 198.133.199.103  GNS2.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.
The upshot of this is that correct DNS resolution for IE DNS data that
has been added or updated since last Friday is going to be 
intermittant. If you're lucky your resolver will query one of the five
nameservers that are publishing an up-to-date zone. Unfortunately, five
out of nine aren't good odds.
Don't forget, if you lose the gamble your resolver is going to cache
the bad data for up to two days.
If you're a user of BIND 8 or BIND 9 you could add
	blackhole {
		192.16.202.11;
		192.93.0.4;
		198.133.199.102;
		198.133.199.103;
	};
to your named.conf and restart BIND to avoid query the bad nameservers.
This will prevent _any_ queries to those servers.
Putting
	16.1.0.18
	204.123.2.18
	16.1.0.19
	192.111.39.100
	212.17.32.2
	193.1.142.2
in /service/dnscache/root/servers/ie and restarting dnscache will
have the same result for dnscache users.
ATB,
james
