this is serious. the highly confidential information that dermot is
out of the office has leaked! i think it would be best if we all
email the "Systems Manager" as a matter of urgency. in lieu of an
email address i suggest emailling all of postmaster, info, sales,
hostmaster, webmaster, support and accounts (and any other address
one can think of).
now, considering the critical nature of this leak, if you do not 
receive an adequate reply i think one would be duty bound to raise 
the matter again, and again if needs be, until one gets a 
satisfactory reply.
also, i notice a lot of people on this lot who post from company 
addresses do not have disclaimers on their emails. i would encourage 
everyone in a professional position to raise the matter of 
disclaimers internally and ensure that disclaimers are implemented 
for company emails, stationary and phone systems.
finally, the email-disclaimers advocacy site 
	http://www.emaildisclaimers.com/
may prove to be a useful resource. rather strangely one of the quotes 
on the front-page of their site is:
	'The disclaimers added to the end of emails are not legally 
	binding, but it's always good practice to try and disclaim liability'
	-- Michael Chissick, Head of Internet law at Field Fisher 
	Waterhouse
However, i suggest this quote, partly the initial part, be ignored
and that other more favourable quotes (by self-aggrandising
pundits^W^Wleading experts)  be heeded instead.  Also, there is a
vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large
company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some
kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having
implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a
rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).
Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!
