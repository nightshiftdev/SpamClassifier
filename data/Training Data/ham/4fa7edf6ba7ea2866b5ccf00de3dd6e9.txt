2.95 was where the reintegration effort started and work on the other 
projects fell away. 3.0 was the target for completion of that work.

A lot of those problems seem to have been shaken out by Redhat's ballsy 
gcc 2.96 stunt. I've been trying out RedHat Limbo for a few weeks now, 
equipped with gcc 3.1. I haven't fallen foul of compiler issue so far, 
that I'm aware of anyhow. That said I'm glad I don't do much C++ - seems 
pretty much every version of gcc (2.95, 2.96, 3.0, 3.1, and the 
forthcoming 3.2) breaks C++ binary compatibility in some way or other.
