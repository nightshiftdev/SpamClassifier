I've noticed that the theories on the interconnection
between the latest RH releases is lagging a bit.  In
the interests of a fun discussion, anyone have any
ideas?
So here's some conspiracy bits to lay out.  Can anyone
fit the pieces together?
"Chesapeake Skipjacks" are a class of boats:

Also note: "They were developed from the lines of the
Chesapeake Bay Log Canoe, the Brogan, and the famous
Clipper Ships." Clipper Ships (Chips)?  
Chesapeake College's mascot(s) is(are) the Skipjacks:

This guy owns a "Chesapeake 32" named "Valhalla":

Now, Valhalla -> Limbo seems a little clearer, both
being afterlife-ish concepts of roughly Norse
extraction.
Anyone else?
