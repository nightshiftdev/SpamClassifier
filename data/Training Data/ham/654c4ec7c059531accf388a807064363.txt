{Msg_Mark unseen}
I'm not sure how I missed the need to fix this in app-defaults for "Mark 
Unseen".  I guess that'll be my next CVS fix.

I thought about that.  The first order approximation would be to just add 
using pack .... -side top instead of pack ... -side left, however, since their 
each a different width, it would look funny.

The background color in this window is the same as the background 
color in the ftoc.

hmmm, let me think about it.

The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined in 
app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.  I've been thinking about 
how to dynamically generate highlighting for other sequences, but haven't got 
that figured out yet.

hmmm, that may or may not be my fault...I'll take a look at it.

I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.
