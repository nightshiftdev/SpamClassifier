Interesting. I've always wondered about things 'considered' to be bad. 
Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?
Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto 
or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of 
programming syntax
to make sure people use loops or recursion?
<<To iterate is human, to recurse divine>>
Kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be 'good'.
For example people bang on about polymorphism, but is there actually any advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance?
Hmm.
I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.
