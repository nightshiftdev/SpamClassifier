Exmh keeps turning the folder indicator blue for one folder, and I've read all the messages in the folder.  Driving me nuts.  I've packed the folder, I've deleted the .mh_sequences file there, keeps doing it.  Help!  
I've just recently started using 2.4 (was using 2.2), so perhaps there are things that needed to be deleted/changed in my settings?
