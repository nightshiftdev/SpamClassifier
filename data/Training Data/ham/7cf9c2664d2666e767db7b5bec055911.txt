Not knowing one whit about elliptic curve math, can you provide 
some expert interpretation of these results?
It looks like the old record for, say, 199 bits, has been
blown out of the water by a factor of ~100,000.
Does this mean that Eliptic Curve encryption is
now easily breakable? Or faster than before with
no loss in strength? Or stronger?
Raw bits are OK, cooked bits are better.
