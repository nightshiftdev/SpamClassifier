That might work easily enough for reasonably rigid
solids that can be positioned and fingerprinted. I
think it would be more difficult for other items.
Like a sweater. The exact pattern of threads is never
quite the same, with the loose weave and all. The
problem of automatically capturing any object's look,
adequately to uniquely identifying it later, is still
open research.
