I got that with the earlier URL. Those that say 73/72 at the end work,
though.
I just installed gnome-terminal and I'm impressed by that. I have seom
gtk1 apps to rebuild and put into my own repository (like gaim) so I
didn't do the full session install. Besides, it's HUGE. And it wants to
install stuff like kudzu and parted and who knows what. What's wrong
with dynamic configuration? Dependency hell indeed.
