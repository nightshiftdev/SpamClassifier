Hello Justin
The simplest setup would be to connect a wireless access point to you
hub then use a wireless pcmcia network card in your laptop.  You could
also get some pcmcia to pci adapters or wireless pci network cards for
your desktop machines.
The access point would be configured with a network name (essid) and a
channel number for you wireless network.  The client machine would be
configured with the same network name, it should be able to auto detect
the channel number.
Driver support is very good, there are only a few wireless chipsets,
and I believe that all but the newest 802.11b Plus (22Mbps) and 802.11a
hardware has Linux drivers.
If you need anymore help or info checkout the forums and irc channel at
