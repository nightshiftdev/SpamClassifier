Apparently, yes. Though for me it did suggest all sorts of creepy stuff.
After installing packages one by one and removing some old stuff and
whatnot, the original gnome-session from there suddenly no longer
wanted parted and all that. Go figure.

If you strip out the gnome stuff, it still runs as a Gtk app without the
applet. Maybe you can even leave in the old panel and all that but I
think some files will conflict and have to be overridden with
--replace-files (dangerous). I just rebuilt gaim and made a few changes
to the .spec adding --without-gnome to %configure or such. It might be
nice to separate the panel version from the actual program like debian
does.
Also, bubblemon no longer compiled for me and Yelp had some broken
dependency there.
