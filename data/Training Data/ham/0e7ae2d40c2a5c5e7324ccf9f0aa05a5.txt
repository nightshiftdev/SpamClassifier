sprint, if you haven't seen the marketing yet, is 1st to US market w/postwap
mobile data svc.  to me, there is nada more interesting and impactful going
down in the tech world than mobile visual communications.. and yet no one
seems to give much of a damn that right now that 2 persons can take photos
and share them instantly across space.  this is one of the biggest - and
last - fundamental changes in human communications.  will be as big as the
browser.
