hey,
AFAIK it isn't hard at all to create
your own modified version of the redhat
distro.  There's even a tarball[1] with this
specifically in mind.  The people who built
the Ximian version of RedHat used a system
similar to said tarball.
Building a distro which uses a *BSD ports
system rather than rpm, deb or whatever
would complicate things a tad more IMHO.
It *is* a good idea though.  I've been 
wondering about the same thing for a couple
of months now but always considered it too
complicated to carry out. (If that makes any
sense at all).
I don't discount any other work like for 
example Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe
there is general interest in an Irish distro.
Anyone?
Regards,
Shane.

How unimaginably difficult is this to do?
There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right?
Right.
Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure 
in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other), 
no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places
 such a suggestion would stumble.
Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring
 a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging.
That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox.
Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun.
Just a pseudo random thought.
I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.
