See Jared Diamond's excellent "Guns, Germs, and Steel" for the story.
Eurasians had outrageously huge, dense, populations to incubate and
immunize whole classes of fatal diseases in, and unobstructed
east-west trans-supercontinental disease transport vectors (horses,
the silk road, sailing ships) to spread them around with.
Game over, man. Same thing with war, technology, crops, domestic
animals and everything else worth having in life. :-).
Remember Joel Mokyr's definition of progress from "The Lever of
Riches": Progress is more stuff cheaper.
