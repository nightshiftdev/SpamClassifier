DDS-4 will hold 40 GB, media is about 42 (ex vat)euros per tape
HP do DDS-4 backup tape drives to take those but they're
about 1236 euros (ex vat) and thats for an internal model (taken from
DCB Groups catalogue). There are other brands and various
other tape formats to choose from, but just to give you a rough
benchmark of pricing for that sorta capacity.
Ther are options that will go up to crazy capacities by using
using multiple tapes in a caddy... of course its gonna cost
a lot more.
I'd also be ensuring I had some sort of disk mirroring set up
also... the more redundancy the better (within reason).

Subject: [ILUG] Backup solutions
Hi folks,
I maintain a colocated server on behalf of a small group of individuals,
and am looking at backup solutions. Is it possible to get some sort of low-
end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. 40
Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra cost
but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost.
What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device,
then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the
last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible?
I'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as part
of the charge for colocation is rackspace.
Thanks,
Ciaran.
