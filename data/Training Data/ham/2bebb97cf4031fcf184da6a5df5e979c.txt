As Kevin said, the problem can reputedly be solved using Donald Becker's 
Linux-native utilities for the 3C5X9 series.  Turn off PnP, and then set 
the IRQ and I/O base address as required.  Make sure those are also
made available in the motherboard BIOS Setup program to "Legacy ISA
devices" or whatever it's called, there.
