Hi,
I'm going to be using MySQL in an upcoming project (and probably
buying their support license), and I'm wondering if anyone else
has used any libraries to link a proprietary C++ project to a
MySQL database. From what I can see on the MySQL website, their
MySQL++ library is under the GPL, but there's also some documents
which list it as under the LGPL.
Anyone got any experience with this, or has used a different
library to link C++ and MySQL under Linux?
Regards,
Vin
