	I've been thinking about this sort of thing
	lately, and how the technological realization
	of these issues is one that enforces *absolute*
	control of content, where the original legal
	strictures (copyright) only enforced a limited
	time limited right to content.
	What I'm wondering is this:  if you give
	people absolute control of copyright, whose
	works will be around in 100 years?  Because
	I'm starting to think that the content
	creator who wants to produce for posterity
	had better do it in such a way that the
	content is *not* "protected", or the content
	will be inaccessible to people in 15 years,
	much less 100.
	This of course assumes that the content
	control mechanisms aren't so pervasive that
	one *cannot* create content without going
	through controlled channels.
