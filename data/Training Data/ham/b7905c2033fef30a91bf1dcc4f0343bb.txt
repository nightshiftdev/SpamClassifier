Hi,
    Can anyone offer me any advice on using an MRi dual port PCI - serial
card.  MRi claim it works, but that not at 9600 baud.  I AM using it at
9600, but I get a 10s delay on output, followed by just 16 bytes,
repeated untill complete.  Similarly, on input, I get a delay before the
app' sees the data.
TIA
Shane
