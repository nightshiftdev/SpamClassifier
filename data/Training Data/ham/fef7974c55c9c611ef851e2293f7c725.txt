Socialism increases regulation which increases corruption.  But that
doesn't matter as much as if the official law does not conform to the
facts on the ground.
If you don't match the law to the facts on the ground, you wind up with
a two-tier society (De Soto's Bell Jar).  Worse, the massive evasion of
the official law encourages the corruption you speak of.
In some countries, the agencies in charge of registering property also
arrange for illegal living arrangements for their employees.  They do
this because even the people who run the system can't make it work for
people they care about.
