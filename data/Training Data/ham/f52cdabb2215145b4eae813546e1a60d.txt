It's not so much an alternative as it is a small
variant of the US's own welfare capitalism. In
these matters, we're like brothers who think our
differences great, not seeing that we are like peas
in a pod until we compare ourselves to strangers
from other cultures and lands. Of course, yes, it
does make a difference to the unemployed whether
they are collecting benefits in Texas or New York.
