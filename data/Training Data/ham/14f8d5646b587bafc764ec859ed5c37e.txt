 Indeed. Personally, I think it's the sort of reprehensible behavior that
split Unix way-back-when into the mess it was in a few years back, before
Linux...got rid of most of them.
 Vendors wrote their own wierd-ass installers & config tools to lock
people to their OS, they added all sorts of functionality that was not
availible to other OSes to make themselves different from the competition
(Motif on non-free OSes, incompatible filesystems etc).
 While a good idea when you share code & standards, in an environment
where you do neither, the user suffers.
