Looking at http://www.sapdb.org/history.htm , it seems that SAP went
open-source some time in 2000, so my information likely was correct
at the time I compiled that list.
In addition, please note that, just because a company decides to go open
source with a codebase as of some new release version, that doesn't make
all versions ever released open source retroactively.  A licence
attaches to a _copy_ of a creative work.  So, if there was a
proprietary, non-redistributable copy in SuSE boxed sets, it's still
proprietary and non-redistributable -- unless SAP AG decided to mail out
a separate permission grant for it.
