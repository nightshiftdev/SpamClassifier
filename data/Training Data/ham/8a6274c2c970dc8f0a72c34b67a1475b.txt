When you can hold and sponsor a giant restrictive device (using giant
restrictorism principles, then,) conference/exhibition and get 30 invited
exhibitors, with lecturedemos, on elastic polity, concepts of public
responsibility have gone rather far off theory into quartering.
The way I reckon it, they plan on fixing the seats/plane and security
problem by further sectioning airplanes:
	1- Checked luggage
	2- Calcium formerly in passengers and crew
	3- The rest of the passengers
	4- The cabin and crew, who get a calcium substitute more
	   readily controlled by a quorum of preservatory agencies.
	5 (optional:) - Premium services and DRM for checked laptops.
They reactivate calcium channels and put the calcium back when
you arrive.  If you don't like it, you have to claim it as they put the
calcium back, subject to retries, and you have to remember the flight
number you actually arrived on to do that.
...and you suddenly know all about vendors!
