Vipul, can I ask questions about SpamNet here?
I hope so, here goes.. simple question.  How do you define
username/passwords in spamnet?  I don't see any fields for this option, so
I'm assuming when someone connects with SpamNet for the first time, they're
given a unique ID that they keep until they change to a new Outlook client?
It would be nice if you could specify which username/password to use.  I'd
like to share my trust account between my work(outlook) and my personal(mutt)
email accounts.
