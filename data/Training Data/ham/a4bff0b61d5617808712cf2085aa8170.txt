      Improved logic for detecting spam, now we only look at
       visible and/or significant mime parts.  [chad, vipul]
      Mime parts cleaned to only whitespace are now ignored
       on the client side, that is, they are not checked
       against server [chad]

      Quieted more warnings [chad]

       that part.  [chad]

      Fixed a bug when we rediscover, we save info to list
       correctly but when using it we skip the first server

      Fixed whitelist so rule 'from xx' only matches 'From:
       .*xx' not 'From .*xx' (Note the ':') [chad]
      Made exit codes cleaner [chad]
        0 or 1       => no error
