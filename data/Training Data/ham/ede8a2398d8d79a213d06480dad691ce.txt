Every once in a while, I get notifications in my root mailbox that my
personal mail is being rejected.  The message is 'No Catalogue Servers
available at this time.'  Since I use razor V1 through Mail::Audit
(using is_spam), I tried several ways to try to trap this error and
allow my mail to be delivered on these occassions but nothing seemed
to work.
I started digging through the code and found several uses of exit
inside the razor code.  This is a very anti-social thing for a module
to do.  It takes away my option to bypass the spam check and deliver
the mail anyway.  The razor modules should signal errors through die
or warn.  razor-check could catch these and, knowing it's being called
during mail delivery, issue an appropriate message and exit status for
the MTA.  The razor modules don't know who's calling them and
shouldn't make this decision.  I'm wondering how much legitimate mail
I'm missing because of this.
I certainly hope this is being addressed in the new version.
