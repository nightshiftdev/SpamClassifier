Hello fork,
  Whilst digitally meandering around google answers
  (answers.google.com) I came upon an interesting question:  'Whats
  the coolest geektoy for under $50'  and an equally nifty answer
  (albiet a bit off the mark for the question, but it wasn't my money,
  so who cares).

  Hee.   Visualization with real lights instead of just winamp.
  Sliiiiccckk.
