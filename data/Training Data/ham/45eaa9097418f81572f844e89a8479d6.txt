hello!
well in my eyes something like a public contrib repository would be nice (where everyone can at least upload spec files) and a something like a "repository directory" with a collection of available repositorys and their content.
i am personally on a dsl dialup connection with 16kb/s upstream cap and that kinda sucks perhaps i am gonna still create a respository for small windowmaker dockapps in the future :).
what do you think?
thanks,
che
