Could anyone who is interested clarify this for me.
Or point me in the direction of a site that does GPL case studies where there may be a similar issue. I have had a google around and the PHP site wasn't help full and the GPL page didn't seem to have this senario.
The setup is as follows:
I develop a piece of code using PHP 3.0.9 which is, to
my knowledge, GPL. 
The piece of code runs on my server and is an integral part of a system that I have developed for a client. I did not recieve  payment for this particular piece of code but I did recieve payment for the system. My client now wants to  
use a different service provider but keep my code. 
Do I have a right to claim intellectual property rights for  my little piece of code that he did not pay me for or do I have to give the client the code under the GPL.
I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated
