Absolutely, to buy a machine and hope later that linux will take to it is
beyond naive. There is a lot of support, mailing lists, web sites, etc that
will help people decide if Linux is going to like a box or not, use them.

There *IS* a Dell/Redhat alliance. It lead to a shocking amount of Dell
systems being easily configurable with RHL.

You make it sound that incompatibility has been deliberately built into the
new systems. The products that any company sell with linux installed will be
easily reinstalled with linux. The products sold with Windows only may not
be. Having said that I've never found a Dell system it was impossible to put
RH on. I have had one or two headaches in the past doing it, though.
