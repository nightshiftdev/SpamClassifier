  It's 1:30AM. Hours ago, my server seemed to stop working. I could ping
  it, but I couldn't do anything else. We drove over to see what was up.
  ... I'll just say that everything broke. Repeatedly.  ...  I think I
  have a small idea what it's like to be Evan now. This is not what I want
  to be when I grow up.
Never mind that -- I think you now have an idea what it's like to be
an on-call sysadmin ;)
