well, smtp being store and forward, what is an smtp proxy? :) that's 
why i said "proxy".
probably, the most effective way to stop spam in the long-term is to 
configure your email server to use the SPEWS blacklist and a good open 
relay blacklist.
SPEWS: to force ISPs to take action against spammers 
SPEWS /will/ list entire ISP netblocks /if/ the ISP consistently
ignores/fails to take action on abuse reports over the course of
several months. however, they're pretty quick at delisting once action
is taken. in the long-term, and in absence of global and effective 
anti-UCE regulations, it's the only realistic way to get to a spam 
free internet.
Open relay lists: to protect against relays obviously.
