Fluxbox is yet another windowmanager for X.
It's based on the Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like blackbox and 
handles styles, colors, window placement and similar thing exactly like 
blackbox (100% theme/style compability).
Many changes and improvements have been made to the code, such as window tabs, 
iconbar, native keygrabber, gnome and kde support etc.
