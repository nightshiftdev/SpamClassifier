We're currently using a perceptron classifier. It *can't* learn
combinations of rules.[1]
I gave an example, assume 4 rules:
   SPAM = (A or B) and (C or D)
It cannot learn that function.
A decision tree classifier *can* learn that example, and the function
above, where a .5 S/O rule is only important in certain
circumstances. (Then again, it may be smartest to hardcode a meta-rule
for that case, rather than trust to a naive DT learner.)
