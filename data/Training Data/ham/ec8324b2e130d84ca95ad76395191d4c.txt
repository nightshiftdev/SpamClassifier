As a practical matter, I doubt the value sold in such situations ever
adds up to the value lost.  And the non-pecuiary since of violation,
loss, and trouble has to get in there somewhere if we are really picky.
I don't think considering marginal utility of dollars has value in this
situation.  We aren't debating whether the thief is better off -- he is.
I'm not a lawyer either.  I played one on TV once but I didn't play a
very good one and they canceled it after the first episode ...
The situtation I described came from my recollection of Epstein's
'Takings'.  He was specifically rejecting the idea of absolute property
right found in Liberation theology and was using the idea -- that in an
emergency where my life depends upon it I'm entitled to violate your
property rights and (more) you are forbidden from using unreasonable
force to defend them (particularly if you aren't around).
Maybe I did get it all wrong, but that particular recollection is
relatively strong precisely because it gave a good reason why my
libertarian theology needed to be modified.
He was also analyzing what the common law had come up with, which might
not be the statuatory law in a particular jurisdiction.
