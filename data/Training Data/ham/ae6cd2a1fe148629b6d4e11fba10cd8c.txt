Unfortunately, there are few comments in this part of the code.  I haven't 
been helping that situation much, although there are some comments in the new 
sequence stuff that I wrote.  I have cleaned up a bit of code so that 
it's a little more clear what it's doing and a little less delicate.  I also 
gratuitously renamed some variables for clarity.
My last few bug fixes were purely problems that I created in my own 
patches and I can't blame anyone but myself.
As I'm avoiding real work, I may clean up a little bit more (and probably 
break a few things as well ;-).
Chris
