I've just checked in a rather large patch which replaces the Unseen Window 
with a new Sequences Window.
Since the preference items are different, you'll need to turn the display of 
the sequences window on in the preferences even if you had the unseen window 
enabled.  I couldn't figure out how to default the preferences to match the 
unseen window.
I'm hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are purely 
cosmetic changes.
For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to display 
the other sequences.  Preferences allow you to say if you want a given 
sequence display to never show or to always show.
I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
week or so ago.
The two things that I know I need to do are to fix the performance issue that 
I think is what Anders was seeing yesterday and to catch the documentation up 
with the code.
My wife is out for an "evening with the girls" tonight, so I should be able to 
work on the performance issue tonight and check it in after some testing in a 
day or two.
I hope I didn't break very much with all the changes I made...
Chris
