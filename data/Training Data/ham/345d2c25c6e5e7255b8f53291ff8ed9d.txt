Indeed.
The ftp'able tree (e.g., 8.0 for i386) contains to my knowledge only
items whose licences allow public redistribution, even where they aren't
open source.  The retail boxed sets (Personal Edition, Professional
Edition, and Enterprise Edition) _add_ a number of additional
proprietary apps that are very much _not_ freely redistributable.
I made a list, a while back:
Freely redistributable proprietary apps in SuSE
----------------------------------------------
UofW pine/pico/pilot
John Bradley's xv graphics tool
T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars's xforms/xformsd graphics toolkit
(some others)  
NON-freely redistributable apps (in boxed sets):
-----------------------------------------------
Siemens AG's DB4Web middleware
Poet Software Corp. FastObjects SDK for Java and C++
IBM Java 2
Intel-v92ham winmodem driver
MainConcept GmbH's MainActor video-editing package
www.mimer.com's MimerSQL
MGE UPS Systems's Personal Solution Pac (MGE power management software)
Real Networks's RealPlayer
Adobe Acrobat Reader
Software AG's ADABAS D
H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH's AntiVir V
Knox Sofware Comm.'s Arkeia
Datan's dataplore digital-signal analysis package
Enterprise Solution Server (ESS) ERP system
Sun Microsystems Java2
Borland Kylix Open Edition
Moneydance
OpenEIS enterprise information system
Opera Software's Opera browser
Heisch Automatisierungstechnik's rk512 serial interface to Simatic S5 /
    S7 plcs
SAP database
Sun Microsystems Star Office
VMware, Inc's VMware
http://www.vshop.org/'s vshop e-commerce software for MySQL
  
All of the latter category either are available only via retail sale, or
are available lawfully on the public Internet only from authorised
distribution sites or on CDs from authorised distributors.  The exact
terms differ.
For example, you can download Borland Kylix Open Edition from
borland.com, free of charge -- but you'll notice there's no mention of
any right to redistribute.  That right is reserved by default to the
copyright owners, and Borland doesn't include it in the Kylix
proprietary licence.
