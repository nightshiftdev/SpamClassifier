Quoting John P. Looney (valen@tuatha.org):

I've not seen any claim from SuSE of copyright over the distribution 
as a whole.  (That would be a "compilation copyright", to use the legal
term.)  But they definitely assert (and in fact own) copyright over
YaST, YaST2, and the associated installer program.
So, if one wanted to distribute a version of SuSE free of encumbrances
from SuSE Linux AG, one would merely have to write a replacement
installer and do without YaST/YaST2 (and probably a few other things
they wrote).  A Simple Matter of Programming.
