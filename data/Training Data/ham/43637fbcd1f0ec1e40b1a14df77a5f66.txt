I'll give that a looksie.  I've been running a week's worth of 
maillog relay= IPs through rbcheck every Sunday.  Found quite a few. 
I should break up the list and run multiple rbcheck instances.  Just 
haven't gotten there yet though.  I think I'll have either MIMEDefang 
or Procmail keep a copy of messages over a certain score for daily 
razor-reporting.  I could just let SA do it too I suppose.
Say, maybe you can tell me what I'm doing wrong in SA.  I added 
report_header 1 to my 
/etc/mail/mimedefang/spamassassin/sa-mimedefang.cf but it didn't 
appear to change anything.  I bounced over another copy of spam to my 
spamtrap and it still created the SPAM: attachment.  sa-mimedefang.cf 
has this in it now:
required_hits           1
auto_report_threshold   100
ok_locales              en
rewrite_subject 0
report_header 1
use_terse_report 1
defang_mime 0
skip_rbl_checks 1
I can't figure out if that was the write cf to modify or not.  I also 
have a /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf but it's empty.  I think I 
might be taking too many bites out of too many pies at once. :-)  The 
required_hits changes I made to sa-mimedefang.cf seem to have worked. 
I don't know why the report_header change didn't though.  Any ideas?
Justin
