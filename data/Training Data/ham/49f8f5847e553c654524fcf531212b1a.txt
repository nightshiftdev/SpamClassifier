A man is out driving in the country, and drives past a farm with the most
beautiful pig -- fat, healthy, pink, clean, etc. Just a lovely pig. He gets
out to admire the pig, and notices that it has a wooden leg! The farmer
comes by and says "Howdie", and the passerby says "I was just stopping to
admire your pig. What a lovely pig. But what's with the woo..." The farmer
interrupts "Oh, yes, this is the most wonderful pig! When our house had a
huge fire a few years back, and was burning down, this pig came in and
squealed and made sure we all woke up and got out. She really saved our
lives!" "My", says the passerby, "what a great story. But what's with the
wooden l..?" The farmer jumps in again: "And then, when my youngest was out
in the street playing just a few months ago, and a big tractor trailer came
barrelling down on her, this pig jumped right in and pushed her out of the
way, getting them both to the side of the road before the truck came by!"
"I'll say, that does show great bravery," said the passerby. "But, if you
don't mind my asking, what *is* the deal with the wooden leg?" The farmer
paused. "Well," he said, "a pig like that -- you don't want to eat it all at
once!"
