I'm decoding this to mean:
"This spec file installs in the system, rather than in the build root,
even though I am passing the relevant overrides to make. It is as if the
Makefile does not allow overrides, or does not have those variables."
I note that:
1) It's one of those Makefile.PL things.
2) While I know that Makefiles generated by a ./configure generated in
turn by a later version of auto* do support the technique you're trying,
I know nothing about what the Perl MakeMaker (or whatever it is)
supports.
The general solution for cases like this is to install manually (Try
make -n and see what it does). I think that Perl's installer system
might support an installation root, though I've blissfully no idea how
to operate it.
I suggest finding a small Perl module SRPM and looking at the spec file
to see how RedHat (or Turbo, or PLD, although RedHat generally know
*all* the tricks) do it.
Dave.
