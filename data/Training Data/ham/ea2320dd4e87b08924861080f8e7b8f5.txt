Yup I'm running it on my k6 233 laptop. It's tres sweet.
I would recommend getting wvdial, opening a virtual terminal dialing the internet and then emerging the packages you need.
I did my install over my home lan and the lan in work (which has DSL - running Linux as firewall/router/mailserver of course).
But yes you will need at least wvdial to make this puppy happen me thinks.
In fact it looks as if the base install comes with wvdial for just this kind of instal.
But I just found this on the Gentoo site for you.

Specifically
quote:
If it is not too obvious, these are the steps I took.
    * Boot off the install CD
    * modprobe serial
    * setserial (if needed)
    * create mount point for other distribution
    * mount other distribution
    * chroot'd to other distribution
    * su - to regular user
    * ran wvdial
    * switch consoles and install as normal
And yes I do give better technical support to people who use
distros I like.
I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.
