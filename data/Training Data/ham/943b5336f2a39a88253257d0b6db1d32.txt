Yeah yeah yeah. I tried it (over a year ago) and it sucked like a new vacuum
cleaner. Although I expect that it will be a lot better by now. What I would
really like to see is Gnome on one of the Sun Ray thin terminals.

Er, I mean normal fashion for a Linux install. This would be distro
specific, anyway.
I am sure it would be possible to do an automated install with a few script
changes. I would not be surprised if Debian does this already.
I do know that if you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are
picked up by silo. So:
  boot disk linux
would not prompt for selection but would boot straight through. From there
it is a matter of tftp'ing the correct config file and the install would be
automatic from there on.

The problem is that the time between linux booting and when the console tty
drivers are started can be a black hole, without error messages or log in
prompts. The other problem is that sometimes Linux will drop in to the PROM
on shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting. Without a serial cable or
keyboard it is not possible to reboot the box without flicking the power
switch hidden at the back of the case.
I think if the console is ttya/ttyS0 it will drop into PROM. If it is
/dev/null then you do not get console messages but the box will shut down
properly.
