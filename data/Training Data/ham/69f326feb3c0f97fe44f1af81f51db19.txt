Look at my friend Jonathan's company, VOXEO.  Unless you're going 
to run out and build a platform that executes Voice XML code and 
can support IMAP etc. then the easiest way to do this is to 
leverage VOXEO's service.  You can start building on it for free 
and you will pay > $0.10 per minute for the pleasure of 
using/testing the service.

If you have about $50K to throw at the project then you can look at 
NUANCE, which has a platform that combines VoiceXML/VXML, Speech 
Reco, and the L&H speech synthesize, which will allow you to have 
your email read to you by Stephen Hawking.
TellMe & BeVocal have off-the-shelf services that do this, though, 
but from my testing, they suck.
If I were to build this I'd spec a lightweight IMAP client and 
VoiceXML browser and dump them on VOXEO.
However, you'll find this to be extremely slow and frustrating.  
Better to us a screen phone with a WAP client.
