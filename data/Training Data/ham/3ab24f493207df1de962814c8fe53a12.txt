More like Apple's implementation - the Gconf2 files are bog-standard 
XML, should you feel tempted to edit it by hand :)
There are some possibilities that using standardised configuration tools 
provide: the ability to centrally manage a large number of computers - 
something like Windows' group policy. Although that would require other 
applications to use GConf as well .
Haven't installed Limbo beta2 myself - been sidetracked by work; the 
fact that the computer I'm installing it on is connected to a dodgy USB 
ADSL modem that requires heavy kernel patching means that I would have 
to do it over a weekend - but I don't think Red Hat currently does it 
for its config tools.
