Maybe I'm the only one confused but what you are saying is that you
have a spamtrap that receives Bugtraq messages and you are auto-
matically reporting them as SPAM only to revoke them shortly there-
after???  Either way automatic reporting is a Bad Thing (tm) IMHO.
You should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise.  I'm not
sure how this would affect your rating because I don't have any docs
nor code to look at but I sincerely hope that if that's what you
are doing that it negatively impacts your rating at a near exponential
rate with every report/revoke cycle.
