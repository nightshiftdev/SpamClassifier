This works when you are defining a switch that %configure
does not already define, but how can we override an
existing switch?  For example,
  prefix: /usr/local
  %configure --prefix=%{?_prefix:%{prefix}}
would be desirable for making a .rpm package relocatable,
but this doesn't work.  'configure' receives two switches,
the default '--prefix=/usr' and the (attempted) override
'--prefix=/usr/local', but it only recognizes the first one.
