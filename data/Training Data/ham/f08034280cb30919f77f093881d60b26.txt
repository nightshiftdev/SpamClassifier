Intuitively, that sounds right to me.  It does also call "tag remove", so 
you'll have to make sure that gets set correctly as well.
I think any changes that make it behave more intuitively are a good thing even 
if they mean we have something else to fix.  Of course, that attitude is why 
I've been fixing exmh bugs for 3 weeks.
