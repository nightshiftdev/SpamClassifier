Hi,
I am looking at the options for a UNIX/Linux Virtual Server capable of holding multiple domains - preferably not tooo expensive as I am not a business. I wish to build a few PHP/MySQL sites and host them...
A rough list of features I am after are
Circa 50MB-100MB web space for now
POP email accounts 
Account Control Panel 
Perl 
PHP 
MySQL 
FTP and Telnet Access 24/7
Own CGI-BIN
Webalizer Graphical Stats 
Server Side Includes 
Good Reachable Technical Support
I have seen a great looking 300MB solution in the region of 600Euro p.a. which at the moment is a bit over my financial head in one payment - I haven't completed any sites yet, but have a few potential jobs coming up.
Any tips/pointers much appreciated!
Regards,
Elvin
