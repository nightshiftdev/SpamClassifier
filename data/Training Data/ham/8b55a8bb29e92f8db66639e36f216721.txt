Hi, folks -
Wearing my other hat today - we're looking for a competent and
experienced system administrator here, and I'd like anyone who's
interested to contact me.
The job is for a Windows (NT and 2000) and Linux (Debinan) system and
network administrator, with a good, deep knowledge of both
environments.  The successful candidate will have a broad range of
responsibilities in maintaining and developing our IT and production
infrastructure, including WAN/secure networking to remote offices,
email systems management, backups, etc., so experience in managing
larger networks is required.
Some development and implementation research experience would also be
highly desireable.
In addition, the position will involve internal IT support for a
primarily Windows network with approximately fifty users in several
locations.
The precise remuneration package will depend on the skillset of the
successful applicant, but will include as standard a performance-based
bonus scheme, health insurance, stock options and participation in a
company-backed pension plan.
Please contact me directly if you wish to apply.
We now return you to your regularly-scheduled hrishy.
           Colm
