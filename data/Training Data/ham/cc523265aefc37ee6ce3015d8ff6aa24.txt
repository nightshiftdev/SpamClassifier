Hi, 
I'm looking to build a completely silent pc. It's gonna be a gateway for
a wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only
spitting distance from the chimney where i'll be mounting the aerial) 
It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need? 
I'll prob use a shitty p166 i have here, it doesnt have a fan, and I'm not
worried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?) 
any info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new
shoebox size totally silent pcs and I cant use an old laptop as I have a
pci wireless card and cable already bought (160$ or so)
And where can I get a fanless psu? I know they exist because the lads
at antefacto had them (lads, where can I get one?). Although I do remember
a slight lack of metal box around the humongous voltage parts!
