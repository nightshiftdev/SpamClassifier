No problems installing OpenOffice 653??? and 1.0. Had some issues with bz2's
being corrupted but fixed when downloaded again. 
I am downloading the src of 1.01 at the mo to se if it will work any faster
compiled for my architecture.

Hi All,
Just wondering if anyone has ever installed StarOffice
6.0 (or Open Office), and if any have experienced any
problems with the install freezing ?
I'm using RedHat 7.3 kernel 2.4.18-3, and glibc 2.2.5
?
I might try downloading OpenOffice instead if it is
unresolved!!!!
Cheers all,
Colin
