True, but would still enable you to do a network install without using boot 
floppies. Then again, boot floppies are cheaper, and easier to recreate 
when you'd like to do some changes to it. Gets messier when you'd have a 
boot image on a server, and the only way you can test it is to boot it over 
the network. In any case, it's just one option available.

Too bad they didn't go with that then. Would have been so much nicer than 
the old MSDOS crap. I do like the OpenBoot idea actually. Especially being 
able to set the PROM to boot from whatever disk slice you'd want. No need 
to set that in lilo/grub any more in that case, since the OpenBoot rom 
takes care of that part for you. Then again, you wouldn't get a menu that 
allows you to choose what you want to boot. There's good and bad, all 
depending on what you want to do, I suppose. Sitting here and typing I'm 
realising that it is both a nice thing, and a nasty thing..
Ah well, life sucks as well, some say.. ;)
