Is this to mount an OS-X partition?
The following would be of interest in that case:

summary is you should be able to mount FFS readonly,
and the config item probably UFS:
[padraig@pixelbeat ~]$ grep UFS /boot/config-2.4.18-3
CONFIG_UFS_FS=m
# CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE is not set
So `modprobe ufs` should work on a standard RH7.3 install?
