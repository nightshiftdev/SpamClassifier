Well, IMNHO, its because companies do not reward knowledge sharers. When 
time comes for evaluation, there isn't a line on the page saying "Helped 
others to succeed with their projects." Sharing inevitably cuts into the 
time for personal productive work, and generally shows up as a red flag 
if your boss has a "management by exception"(1) style.
