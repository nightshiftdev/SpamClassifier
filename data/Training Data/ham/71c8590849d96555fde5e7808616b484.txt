Well, first you need to look at the Makefile.PL to see if it uses the
PREFIX you're trying to pass to it or not. Maybe you'll need to "override"
other paths when doing the "make".
Second, the "%makeinstall" macro automatically overrides many common values
like "prefix=" or "datadir=", so it's completely redundant with the
"PREFIX=" you're passing to it. Take a look at the "Makefile" you have at
that point to see how the "install" target is, and what it uses.
Last, as Chris suggested, you can take a look at an existing package, like
the one in Rawhide ;-)
