 There is no canonical test, and the information is not necessarily
 available. If you check out how struct stat is defined on your system,
 you'll find that only
     time_t   st_atime;    /* Time of last access */
     time_t   st_mtime;    /* Time of last data modification */
     time_t   st_ctime;    /* Time of last file status change */
                           /* Times measured in seconds since */
                           /* 00:00:00 UTC, Jan. 1, 1970 */
 are available. File status change = i-node status change, it includes
 creation, mode change, ownership change etc., so this is what you want
 only if the file status wasn't changed since creation.
 This information is also shown by ls -lc, but parsing ls' output requires
 a bit of effort. I'd rather recommend to write a short C program to access
 the file status directly, and output the ctime directly (seconds since
 the epoch, i.e. perfect for numerical comparison).
 (Another way is to use GNU find -printf with a custom format:
  ...
            %c   File's last  status  change  time  in  the  format
               returned by the C `ctime' function.
