Because you then have a system that is ineffective to a varying degree. A
simplistic view would be that 999 subscribers received a piece of spam
that could have otherwise been avoided. But the reality is likely that
many, many more individuals would have received the piece of spam when you
factor in report times.

Wrong. razor-check will tell you if a specific piece of mail matches
something already in the database. If you have the system pretend to have
never seen a piece of mail, how do you propose people use the system for
filtering?

No, it means that the people doing the revoking have a different opinion
than the 1000 people who have submitted it as spam. Rather the 1000 people
who have reported the message as spam constitute a majority or not is
something that would have to be determined in the context of the
individual message.

You always have that ability.

It's my opinion that it's not my job to unsubscribe to any list that I
haven't subscribed to, nor is it necessarily in my best interest given
that some parties sending unwanted communications may utilize the
unsubscribe request as a method of determining they are mailing a valid
address.

See above.
