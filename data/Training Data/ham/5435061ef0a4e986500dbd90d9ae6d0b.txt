I successfully made the leap to Razor 2.14.  I did have a bit of trouble
with Digest::MD5 on Mandrake 8.1 and Mandrake 8.2.  On each platform, I had
to reinstall the original version of Digest::MD5 over top of the Digest::MD5
v2.20 that Razor-SDK installed.  Otherwise, Perl refused to compile a thing.
I should have some effectiveness stats on Razor 2 in a few days.  We will
see what % of our corporation's spam it detects.
