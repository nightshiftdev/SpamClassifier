Not sure Motif is a good example, really. When Mozilla was going through its
"Let's Use Motif/Let's Not" phase, Jamie Zawinski mentioned in passing that the
installed base of Motif-bearing systems kicked the installed base of
Linux-bearing systems into a huddled ball. Something, perhaps, to do with the
fact that every
Sun/Solaris box since version mumble shipped with it, plus every HP/UX box,
and
for all I know every other mainstream proprietary Linux. Motif was more a
unifier across Unix subspecies than a differentiator.
Now, filenames longer than 14 characters, maybe, or the options for ps (are we
sysv or bsd?), or the whole /dev tree, or the libc implementation...
Cheers,
Waider.
