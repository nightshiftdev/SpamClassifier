 See, the IDE subsystem is like the One Ring. It's kludginess, due to
having to support hundreds of dodgy chipsets & drives means that it is
inherintly evil. A few months of looking at the code can turn you sour.
Years of looking at it will turn you into an arsehole.
 They haven't found a hobbit that can code, so mortal humans have to
suffice.
